# My colourwheel

This is the first attempt to modify the code. You can toggle to the new implementation
by using the "w" key. 

The mirror problem with colours has now been solved. There could still be done
some improvement on the color ring because a small shift comes in with higher number
of segments.

For now, it is working fine with 20 segments. There's a correction in the code,
that can be adjusted.
