# My colourwheel

This is the first attempt to modify the code. You can toggle to the new implementation
by using the "w" key. 

The mirror problem with colours has now really been solved. You can select the number of segments now
for the modified as well as the original wheel.

Note, that increasing numbers of segments makes the difference between QUAD strips and
ARCS invisible in the end.
